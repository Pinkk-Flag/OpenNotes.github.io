## How does taking notes in Notion work?
![Alt text](/src/thumbnail.png)
At the beginning of each lesson, hopefully someone (or you) could create a new page in the respective folder. Then, it's quite simple! Just take your notes with your peers. Maybe split work, maybe think together, all that matters is that you collaborate and save time. 

## When will the files get deleted and reuploaded?
Typically, they will be deleted on a Friday or a Saturday, and reuploaded on a Saturday. However, they may occasionally be change to this. However, please read the shutting down section here, because it won't get updated from now on.

## Why is it shutting down in 2023?
There are  a few reasons
1. Notes will no longer be relevant next year
2. There is greater potential for this software. That means that if I decide to restart this software next year, it will likely be much more powerful with more dynamic content. This likely means better styling, login system, etc (don't quote me on this)
3. I can only have 1 website up on github. Self explanatory. Of course, there are options such as Versel which will be taken into consideration. 
4. There are likely better ways to go around this than using Notion. Of course, Notion is made for collaborative purposes, however, it is only for larger enterprises who can actually afford to pay for this. Because I can only add Workspace Owners, it means that there is a chace that people could potentially grief certain things. I'm looking into othe softwares such as Obsidian for maybe more versatile collaboration. 

Of course, the notes will still be available in the website (given it doesn't shut down as well) but they will be permanently on the GitHub, which will be archived quite soon. 

## We are archiving :(
From 30/11/23, we will be archiving this repository. It has been great to work with everyone :)
