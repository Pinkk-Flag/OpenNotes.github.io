            <h3>Why does this exist?</h3><br>
            <p>In reality, this started off as just friends wanting to take off the load of school, however, we soon realised the potential this website could give to fellow students and become a network of information. What started as a small-scale initiative between friends blossomed into OpenNotes_, a platform dedicated to facilitating the seamless exchange of study resources. </p>

            <h3>How does OpenNotes_ work?</h3>
            <br><p>OpenNotes_ is a simple yet effective method of organising notes made by students into a concise hub. The general system of OpenNotes_ is for <i>everyone</i> to contribute to the notes no matter the subject. The notes are created on a software called "Notion", a note taking application. We have a community Notion that will be given by certain users once you join the Discord. Every week, the notes are deleted and started anew, with just general folders remaining. All files from past weeks will be archived in the discord or on the website.</p>
